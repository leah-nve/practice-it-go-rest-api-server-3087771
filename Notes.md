# Some Advanced Basics:

- Methods vs. functions
  - Functions: Blocks of code grouped together to perform specific tasks
  - Methods: functions that have a receiver argument
    - You can define methods on types you define in your package
    - A receiver is the argument that a method is called on
  - Struct: A collection of fields
